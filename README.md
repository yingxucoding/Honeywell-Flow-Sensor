# Honeywell-Flow-Sensor
Honeywell digital flow sensor I2C code and python real time plotting
The flow sensor used in this project is HAFUHM0050L4AXT. Two 4Kohm pull up resistors are required in the hardware setup.
Arduino UNO R3 is used to communicate to the sensor and computer.
Python 3.6.4 and Arduino IDE 1.8 are used in this project.
